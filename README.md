# Kailh PG1316S Ultra Low Profile Single PCBs

Very similar to [the Cherry ULP ones](https://github.com/jonboh/amoeba-cherry-ulp), the pcb itself is interchangeable and you can build my ULP Dactyl with either one of them.
But the switches can only be mounted in their corresponding PCB.

The diodes used in the PCBs are `1N4148W SOD323`.
